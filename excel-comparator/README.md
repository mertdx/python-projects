# Excel Comparator

## This Python script compares two excel files cell by cell and generates an another excel file to show you the difference

---

### Usage

- Get the excel_comparator.py and your excel files in the same directory
- Open a terminal window at that directory
- type : `python excel_comparator.py -file1 yourfile1.xlsx -file2 yourfile2.xlsx`
- check the `result.xlsx` on your working directory

I included two sample excel files and ran the code in order to give an example `result.xlsx` file, check them out!

_`Note:` You need Python, pandas, numpy and openpyxl packages and their dependencies to be able to run the script._
